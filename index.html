		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>I am Kunawat ( Ku-Na-WHAT? ) Vitoorapakorn, a recent high school graduate from UWC ISAK Japan. I am lightly equipped with three other languages: Thai, Chinese, and Japanese.
<br><br>
 

I enjoy working with a diverse team of creative people who pushes the boundaries of the norms. I do not have a particular passion, but I love finding unusual solutions and opportunities.  
<br><br>
 

My goal is to create a future of creative solutions. It might come in any form, but I hope to specialise in the design of business,  leadership, and entrepreneurship to help nurture and develop a culture of innovative solutions.
<br><br>
 

I am not confident in my professional skill yet, but I am up for a challenge to learn, improve, and perform. I hope that you will give me a chance.</p>
