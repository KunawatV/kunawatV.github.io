				<h4>Project Brief</h4> <!-- h4 is Header -->
				<p> <!-- Paragraph about it -->
					Math Mate is an Education Technology startup located in Brisbane working in creating a more intuitive way to learn maths for the 21st Century learners.
					<br><br>
					I was assigned to design and develop a new website and brand identity that properly aligns to the company's value, mission and message to help bridge the gap between Math Mate and their target audiences.
					<br><br>
					This involves the creation of the cooperate branding templates, implementation of digital marketing tools, and design/ development of 3 websites: Math Mate, Do Math Good app, and Manic Math app.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="text">
				<h4>Challenges </h4>
				<p>
					The pervious branding scheme was lacking in pictures, strong and consistent brand image, and also had an unclear message.
					<br><br>
					Below is the original website. 
				</p>

				<h4>Process </h4>
				<p>
					The old landing page visuals do not align with the company's products and services, nor does it have a strong branding.
					<br><br>
					In order to align the website to the company's Do Math Good app message, it was made more appealing to the target customers (Teachers, School, Parents, and Students). The website was gamified to be playful and the 4 main branding colours were repeated throughout while using some of the Do Math Good app's asset. With plenty of Call To Actions.
					<br><br>

			<div class="text">
				<p>
					The Math Mate website was targeted to teachers and schools. It contains the company's mission, products, and services.
					<br><br>
					To create trust, the design was clean, simple, and systematic. The branding colours were implemented throughout the website to keep it playful while being quite formal.
					<br><br>

				<p>
					The new brand identity was also implemented beyond digital. It was used for Banners, flyers, T-shirts. 
					<br><br>
					It was also important to create a branding document to help the team member create assets without me. 
				</p>
			</div>

				<h4>Result </h4>
				<p>
					Math Mate now has a clear brand with consistency throughout its products and services, both digital and physical. The brand was also made more appealing to the target customers.
					<br><br>
					The branding doc has helped the team to create their own assets while keeping the branding consistent without having an in-house designer.
